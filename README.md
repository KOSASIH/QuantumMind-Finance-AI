This code provides a framework for utilizing quantum computing principles in financial analysis and decision-making. It includes functions for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the quantum eigensolver, which can be used to optimize financial decision-making processes. The `financial_analysis` function takes in financial data and performs advanced analysis using the quantum algorithms. The example usage demonstrates how to use the code with a sample dataset. Please note that you will need to replace the example data with your own financial data and eigenvalues.

## Dataset 

```python
import numpy as np

data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data = data.set_index('Date')

# Normalize data
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Split data into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(scaled_data) * 0.8)
test_size = len(scaled_data) - train_size
train_data = scaled_data[:train_size, :]
test_data = scaled_data[train_size:, :]

# Prepare data for LSTM model
def create_dataset(dataset, time_steps=1):
    X, Y = [], []
    for i in range(len(dataset) - time_steps - 1):
        X.append(dataset[i:(i + time_steps), 0])
        Y.append(dataset[i + time_steps, 0])
    return np.array(X), np.array(Y)

time_steps = 60
X_train, Y_train = create_dataset(train_data, time_steps)
X_test, Y_test = create_dataset(test_data, time_steps)

# Reshape input data for LSTM model
X_train = np.reshape(X_train, (X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1))

```

This code implements a machine learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for market trend analysis. It preprocesses financial data, trains the model, and generates accurate predictions. The code also includes visualization of the predicted trends alongside the actual data.

## Transaction 

```python
# Import necessary libraries

from datetime import datetime

# Define a class for a transaction
class Transaction:

        self.amount = amount
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        return sha256((self.sender + self.receiver + str(self.amount) + str(self.timestamp)).encode()).hexdigest()

# Define a class for a block
class Block:
    def __init__(self, previous_hash, transactions):
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.transactions = transactions
        self.timestamp = datetime.now()
        self.nonce = 0
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        return sha256((self.previous_hash + str(self.transactions) + str(self.timestamp) + str(self.nonce)).encode()).hexdigest()

    def mine_block(self, difficulty):
        while self.hash[:difficulty] != '0' * difficulty:

        self.difficulty = 4
        self.pending_transactions = []
        self.mining_reward = 10

    def create_genesis_block(self):
        return Block("0", [])

    def get_latest_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]

    def mine_pending_transactions(self, miner_address):
        block = Block(self.get_latest_block().hash, self.pending_transactions)
        block.mine_block(self.difficulty)
        self.chain.append(block)

        self.pending_transactions = [
            Transaction("network", miner_address, self.mining_reward)
        ]

    def create_transaction(self, sender, receiver, amount):
        transaction = Transaction(sender, receiver, amount)
        self.pending_transactions.append(transaction)

    def get_balance(self, address):
        balance = 0
        for block in self.chain:
            for transaction in block.transactions:
                if transaction.sender == address:
                    balance -= transaction.amount
                elif transaction.receiver == address:
                    balance += transaction.amount
        return balance

# Create an instance of the blockchain
blockchain = Blockchain()

# Create transactions
blockchain.create_transaction("address1", "address2", 10)
blockchain.create_transaction("address2", "address1", 5)

# Mine pending transactions
blockchain.mine_pending_transactions("miner_address")

# Get balance of addresses
balance1 = blockchain.get_balance("address1")
balance2 = blockchain.get_balance("address2")
balance_miner = blockchain.get_balance("miner_address")

# Print balances
print("Balance of address1:", balance1)
print("Balance of address2:", balance2)
print("Balance of miner_address:", balance_miner)
```

This code implements a basic decentralized blockchain-based financial system. It includes classes for transactions, blocks, and the blockchain itself. Transactions are stored in blocks, which are linked together through cryptographic hashes. Mining is performed by finding a nonce that results in a hash with a certain number of leading zeros. The code also provides functionality for creating transactions, mining pending transactions, and checking the balance of addresses.
